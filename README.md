## NOTE 
This is by no means a production ready code I only use jupyter notebooks for prototyping.
The submissions were made in a 2 days "competitive environment".

## Problem Statement 
As we know, Cristiano Ronaldo is a legend in the football world. He has played a thousand games & scored hundred of goals . Now, given the dataset of Cristiano Ronaldo’s “attempts on the goal target, in his all recorded & unrecorded matches, predict if he has scored a goal or not . Formally you are given a dataset of attempts taken by Ronaldo , Predict if he scored a goal or not.

## Approach 
Using Random Forests with sub-sampling (Randomly 100 rows chosen) and using ensemble of all trees gave me around 72% IMAE & 0.62 r^2 score.
